crontab setup:

projects/window-shopper master > crontab -l
0 0 * * * cd /Users/jack/projects/window-shopper && . /Users/jack/.profile && /Users/jack/.rvm/ruby-1.8.6-p383/bin/rake jcrew:fetch_price

This runs the command every day at midnight. The above line breaks down to: 

1. cd to the directory where the app exists
2. source the file which sets up the environment for cron (important vars like GEM_PATH)
3. run the rake command
