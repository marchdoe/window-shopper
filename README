crontab setup:

projects/window-shopper master > crontab -l
0 0 * * * cd /Users/jack/projects/window-shopper && . /Users/jack/.profile && /Users/jack/.rvm/ruby-1.8.6-p383/bin/rake jcrew:fetch_price

This runs the command every day at midnight. The above line breaks down to: 

1. cd to the directory where the app exists
2. source the file which sets up the environment for cron (important vars like GEM_PATH)
3. run the rake command


On Sun, 13 Dec 2009 07:20:26 UTC +00:00 I created our first product with url:

http://www.jcrew.com/AST/Browse/MensBrowse/Men_Feature_Assortment/catalogjcrewcomexclusives/sportcoatsouterwear/PRDOVR~10879/99101630642/ENE~1+2+3+22+4294967294+20~~~16~15~all~mode+matchallany~~~~~suede/10879.jsp

Four days later that url is no longer valid. The difference? Look at the url below:

http://www.jcrew.com/AST/Browse/MensBrowse/Men_Feature_Assortment/catalogjcrewcomexclusives/sportcoatsouterwear/PRDOVR~10879/99101630643/ENE~1+2+3+22+4294967294+20~~~16~15~all~mode+matchallany~~~~~suede/10879.jsp

the only difference is in the number after PRD0VR and before the ENE set of numbers: 

99101630642

becomes

99101630643

Hard to know exactly what this means and why. Perhaps every couple days they increment that number to prevent automated searches/scraping? Let's watch this and document here.
